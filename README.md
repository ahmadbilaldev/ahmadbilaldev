### Glad to see you here!  

I am is a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves Open Source. I'm currently working as the founding engineer at Langbase, building the best AI developer platform. 

I'm passionate about Open Source. I recently authored LangUI, which has garnered 2.5K stars and 200K+ users to date. Currently, I'm an active contributor to [BaseAI](https://baseai.dev/), driving innovation in AI development.

I am also a Developer Advocate. I write a lot of JavaScript, Next.js, and MERN Stack while creating content to enable developers to be as excited as I am about these technologies.

These days, my go-to stack is Next.js with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, REST/GraphQL APIs with all types of JS backend framworks inlcuding Hono, Express.
